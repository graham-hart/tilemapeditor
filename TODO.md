# TODO

- Display current layer, tool, and mouse coords
- Fill tool
- More sophisticated palette (tile variations)
- Auto-tiling
- Tiles should render in order of layer (high in back, low in front (but current layer above all else))
- Tiles not on current layer should only be rendered if they're not rendering over another tile (prioritize low-layer tiles)
- Better image loading system accounting for variations of tiles
